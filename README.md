#How to use it
<<pic goes here>>


##Android/iOS
When opening the app for the first time, the user will be greeted by a Login/Register screen. To login, the user will be prompted to enter in their username or email in the first field and their password in the second. To register, the user will be asked to provide a username, academic email, and password. The user will then be asked if the app is allowed to get their current location. The user will then be given a quick tour of the app.

###College Hub
Markit is designed to be used by college students in populated areas. If the particular item a user is looking for is unavailable at their school, or they know they will be visiting a friend who goes to another school, the user can easily filter their search by area and look for items available at specific college campuses. Finding items should be at the convinience of the user, and Markit should be a tool to bring college students together.

###Searching
There are two views which the user can use to view items being sold. Under map view, the user will be able to view a map with multiple markers signifying the seller's general area. Above each marker is a small photo of the object that is up for sell. By clicking the marker, the map centers around the marker and a larger box replaces the photo. This box displays the seller's name, a photo of the item, the name of the item, the approximate distance from the user's current location, the price it is being sold for, and the option to add the item to the user's watchlist. By clicking it again the user is then redirected to the buying page. In the search bar above, the user can type in a location to see what items are being sold in that location.

In list view, a list of items being sold in the immediate area is shown. Each listed item shows a picture of the item shown, the name of the seller, the name of the item, the approximate distance from the user's current location, the price it is being sold for, and the option to add the item to the user's watchlist. By clicking the list the user is redirected to the buying view. At the top of the screen is a search bar where the user can type in a location to only show items in a certain location or the user can enter an item name which will filter items that don't match the tag that was provided.

###Buying
In this view the user can see more details about the products including the name, a photo, and a price. The user can also see the seller's name, their photo, their rating, and their preferred method of payment. Underneath the photo of the product there are two buttons named chat and offer. When the user clicks either of these buttons, the user will be taken to a chat session with the seller. (See Chat Section).

###Selling
The user is shown a list of past sold items. At the end of the list a user can click a button to post a new item. The user is then prompted to add the name of the item being sold, a photo of the item, and tags for the item. By clicking 'next' they are taken to the next page where the user will enter the price of the item and the duration of how long the item will be posted. 

###Profile

The profile view shows the user's profile picture, the user's rating, the user's perferred payment, a list of items the user is currently selling, and a button to report the user.

###Chat
Allows a buyer and a seller to communicate with each other. Along with a button to send messages, the buyer is allowed to send an offer with a price. The seller is able to accept or decline the offer. If it is declined the seller can choose to continue or end communication with the buyer. If the offer is accepted, both parties can continue talking but the item being discussed is considered sold.
