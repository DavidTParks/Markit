##Android/iOS
When opening the app for the first time, the user will be greeted by a Login/Register screen. To login, the user will be prompted to enter in their username or email in the first field and their password in the second. To register, the user will be asked to provide a username, academic email, and password. The user will then be asked if the app is allowed to get their current location. The user will then be given a quick tour of the app.

###Searching
There are two views in which the user can use to view items being sold. Under map view, the user will be able to view a map with multiple markers signifying the seller's general area. Above each marker is a small photo of the object that is up for sell. By clicking the marker, the map centers around the marker and a more larger box replaces the photo. This box displays the seller's name, photo of the item, name of the item, approximate distance from your current location, price it is being sold for and the option to buy or add the item to the watchlist. In the search bar above, the user can type in a location to see what items are being sold in that location.

In list view, by default is shown a list of items being sold in the immediate area. Each listed item shows a picture of the item shown, name of the seller, name of the item, approximate distance from your current location and price it is being sold for.By clicking the list item additional options to buy or to add the item to your watchlist is given. At the top of the screen is a search bar where the user can type in a location to only show items in a certain location or the user can enter an item name which will filter items that don't match the tag that was provided.
