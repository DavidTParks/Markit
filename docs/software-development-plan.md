# 4.0 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 Plan Introduction
MarkIt is an application that aims to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers within a college community by providing them with a means of direct communication. Within the application, users will be able to search, sell, purchase, post, and track goods. The distinction between MarkIt and other similar existing applications is its exclusive availability to verified college students when they signup using a valid .edu email address. MarkIt will be accessible through Android and iOS devices as well as through web browsers. In developing the application, the tasks required for each project member compose of becoming familiar with the database (i.e., Firebase) for storing and retrieving data about users and items, learning the language needed for developing in each (i.e., Swift for iOS, Java for Android, and JavaScript for web), and collaboratively creating the user interface for each of the three platforms mentioned above and implementing a robust search functionality. 

Within the scope of using Firebase, each member should accomplish the following tasks by the designated deadlines:
-   Post-request (09/29)
-   Get-request (09/29)
-   Login/Sign-up (09/29)
-   User Profiles (10/03)
-   Reading Listings (10/03)
-   Creating a New Post (10/10)

Creating the user interface should be accomplished by the following deadlines:
-   Chat Client (10/03)
-   Hub Page (10/17)
-   Searching Items (10/20)
-   Tagging Items (10/26)
-   Reviews (11/02)
-   Map Integration (12/01)
-   Notifications (12/05)

Testing the product should be accomplished by the following date:
-   Beta Testing (12/12)
-   MVP User Interface (12/12)
